## What to do with this demo❓
### Running the executable directly
- You can download and run the current build directly from the releases section (I only build Windows + Linux. Sorry Mac, I got no love for you 💀) if you just want to check it out in real-time or test the speed on your system.
### Downloading the project
- You can clone / download this repo and have a look in the project. It's not a super crazy complicated thing, but eventually some settings can be interesting.
### Contribute
- If you have the feeling that something is missing or if there is a bug, feel invited to open an issue or PR.
- If it is a PR that would change the visuals, please contact me before you start working on it! (**Discord: Picster#0001**)
- **If it is a visual bug or glitch and you have the feeling it is a rendering / engine problem, I would ask you to open an issue in the [Godot Engine GitHub issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) directly.**


## Performance 🌠
If you experience performance problems, you can try changing the graphics settings in the menu (<kbd>ESC</kbd> -> Settings). If this does not help, I'm afraid there is nothing I can do for you. This is a pretty high-end demo when it comes to what Godot 4 can do (although, I use no textures or complicated materials / shaders).
